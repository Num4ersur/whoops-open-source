## Recommended VPNs for Added Security

To enhance your online security and privacy while hosting your project, consider using a Virtual Private Network (VPN). Here are a couple of options:

- **Paid VPNs**:
  - ExpressVPN: Offers strong encryption and a wide range of server locations. [Website](https://www.expressvpn.com/)
  - NordVPN: Known for its robust security features and large server network. [Website](https://nordvpn.com/)

- **Free VPNs**:
  - ProtonVPN: Provides a limited free plan with secure encryption and no data caps. [Website](https://protonvpn.com/)
  - Windscribe: Offers a free plan with a generous data allowance and strong privacy features. [Website](https://windscribe.com/)

Remember that while free VPNs are a good starting point, paid VPNs generally offer more advanced features and stronger security. Choose the one that best fits your needs and budget.

Please note that using a VPN is just one of the measures to protect your online privacy. Always ensure you are using secure practices when hosting with ngrok.
